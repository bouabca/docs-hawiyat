# SSL Certificate Management System

Hawiyat provides a robust SSL certificate management system with multiple options to secure your applications. This guide details the available certificate options and their implementation procedures.

## Certificate Options

We offer three comprehensive certificate management solutions:

### 1. Provider-Managed Certificates (`None`)
- Allows DNS provider's native SSL implementation
- Zero configuration required from Hawiyat
- Automatic certificate management by provider
- Seamless integration with provider's security features

### 2. Let's Encrypt Integration
- Automated certificate generation and renewal
- Zero-cost SSL implementation
- Industry-standard security
- Automatic domain validation

### 3. Custom SSL Certificates
- Support for third-party certificates
- Advanced configuration options
- Enterprise-grade security features
- Custom validation methods

## Detailed Implementation

### Provider-Managed Setup (`None`)

When selecting the `None` option:

1. **Configuration**
   - No `tlsResolver` assignment
   - Provider handles SSL implementation
   - Automatic certificate management
   - Zero manual intervention required

2. **Provider Integration**
   - Works with Adex Cloud's SSL system
   - Compatible with OVH's SSL offering
   - Native integration with Hawiyat.org certificates

<Callout type="info">
**Provider Settings**: When using Adex Cloud or OVH Cloud, their SSL certificates are automatically managed. Select `None` in Hawiyat and disable HTTPS to allow provider certificate management.
</Callout>

## Let's Encrypt Integration

### Overview
Let's Encrypt provides automated, free SSL certificates with enterprise-grade security. Our integration offers:

1. **Automated Management**
   - Zero-touch certificate generation
   - Automatic renewal process
   - Real-time status monitoring
   - Immediate deployment
   - Failure recovery systems

2. **Technical Specifications**
   - 90-day certificate validity
   - RSA and ECDSA key support
   - Automatic key rotation
   - Multi-domain support
   - Wildcard certificate capabilities

### Implementation Process

#### Standard Setup
1. **Initial Configuration**
   - Select `Let's Encrypt` in Hawiyat
   - Enable HTTPS option
   - Verify domain ownership
   - Configure DNS records
   - Wait for propagation

2. **Verification Steps**
   - Confirm DNS resolution
   - Validate certificate installation
   - Check HTTPS accessibility
   - Verify certificate chain
   - Test SSL configuration

<Callout type="warning">
Certificate generation typically takes 20-30 seconds. If generation fails, our system automatically retries with exponential backoff.
</Callout>

### Provider-Specific Configuration
