# Password Recovery System

This guide provides detailed instructions for resetting your Hawiyat platform password. The process is designed to be secure while maintaining ease of use for system administrators.

## Security Considerations

Before proceeding with the password reset process, ensure:
- You have root/sudo access to the server
- Your SSH connection is secure
- The server's firewall rules are properly configured
- No unauthorized users have access to the terminal session

## Reset Process

Follow these detailed steps to recover access to your Hawiyat dashboard:

<Steps>
<Step>
### Server Access

1. Connect to your VPS using SSH:
```bash
ssh username@your-server-ip
```

2. Verify your connection is secure:
```bash
# Check current SSH session details
who am i
# Verify you're using an encrypted connection
echo $SSH_CONNECTION
```

<Callout type="warning">
  Ensure you're using a secure terminal and trusted network connection before proceeding.
</Callout>
</Step>
 
<Step>
### Locate Hawiyat Container

1. List all running containers to identify the Hawiyat instance:
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.ID}}\t{{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}\t{{.Ports}}"
```

2. Verify the container status:
```bash
# Get detailed container information
docker inspect <container-id> | grep -i status
```

<Callout type="info">
The container ID is a unique identifier. Look for a container with "hawiyat" in its name or image.
</Callout>
</Step>
 
<Step>
### Execute Password Reset

1. Access the container and initiate the reset process:
```bash
docker exec -it <container-id> bash -c "pnpm run reset-password"
```

2. Verify the command execution:
```bash
# Check command exit status
echo $?
```

<Callout>
If you encounter any errors, ensure:
- The container is running
- You have the correct permissions
- The pnpm command is available in the container
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Secure Your New Credentials

1. A new random password will be generated and displayed. It will look similar to:
```
New password: xxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx
```

2. Important security steps:
- Copy the password immediately
- Store it securely (password manager recommended)
- Don't share it over unsecured channels
- Change it after first login

<Callout type="warning">
The generated password is temporary. Change it immediately after logging in for security purposes.
</Callout>
</Step>

<Step>
### Access Verification

1. Navigate to your Hawiyat dashboard:
```
https://your-domain-or-ip:3000
```

2. Login with new credentials:
- Username: Your existing username
- Password: The newly generated password

3. Verify access to all necessary features:
- Dashboard functionality
- Container management
- User settings
- System configurations
</Step>
</Steps>

## Post-Reset Security Measures

After successfully resetting your password:

1. **Change Default Password**
   - Navigate to Settings > Security
   - Choose a strong, unique password
   - Enable two-factor authentication if available

2. **Audit System Access**
   - Check access logs
   - Review active sessions
   - Terminate unknown sessions

3. **Update Security Settings**
   - Review permission settings
   - Check API access tokens
   - Update security policies if needed

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during the reset process:

1. **Container Access Issues**

   - Ensure proper permissions: `docker exec -it <container-id> whoami`

2. **Command Execution Errors**
   - Verify pnpm installation: `docker exec <container-id> pnpm -v`
   - Check for error logs: `docker exec <container-id> cat /var/log/hawiyat.log`
   - Ensure proper network connectivity

3. **Login Problems**
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode
   - Check for CAPS LOCK or keyboard layout issues

If problems persist, consider:
- Checking system resources
- Reviewing container health
- Consulting server logs
- Contacting technical support
