# Certificate Management System

## Introduction

The Certificate Management System provides enterprise-grade SSL/TLS certificate handling for securing your applications and services within the Hawiyat platform.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Certificate Authority Integration**
   - Let's Encrypt support
   - Custom CA integration
   - Chain validation
   - ACME protocol support

2. **Key Management**
   - Private key storage
   - Key rotation
   - Encryption standards
   - Access control

3. **Certificate Lifecycle**
   - Automated renewal
   - Expiration monitoring
   - Revocation handling
   - Backup management

## Certificate Operations

### Available Actions

1. **Certificate Creation**
   - New certificate generation
   - CSR processing
   - Key pair management
   - Chain verification

2. **Certificate Deletion**
   - Secure removal
   - Key cleanup
   - Configuration updates
   - Service notifications

### Certificate Creation Process

#### Required Components

1. **Certificate Identity**
   - **Name**:
     - Unique identifier
     - Descriptive naming
     - Organization scheme
     - Version tracking

2. **Certificate Data**
   - Public certificate
   - Intermediate certificates
   - Root certificates
   - Certificate chain

3. **Private Key**
   - Key generation
   - Key strength
   - Algorithm selection
   - Key protection

<Callout type="warning">
Always store private keys securely and never share them through unsecured channels.
</Callout>

## Security Implementation

### Best Practices

1. **Key Security**
   - Minimum 2048-bit RSA
   - Regular key rotation
   - Secure key storage
   - Access logging

2. **Certificate Management**
   - Regular monitoring
   - Automated renewal
   - Backup procedures
   - Audit logging

3. **Access Control**
   - Role-based access
   - Audit trails
   - Change management
   - Emergency procedures

### Validation Procedures

1. **Certificate Verification**
   - Chain validation
   - Expiration check
   - Revocation status
   - Trust verification

2. **Security Checks**
   - Protocol support
   - Cipher suites
   - Key usage
   - Extended validations

## Traefik Integration

### Configuration Process

1. **Basic Setup**
   - Certificate registration
   - Route configuration
   - TLS options
   - Backend services

2. **Advanced Features**
