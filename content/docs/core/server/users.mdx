# User Management System

## Introduction

The User Access Control System provides enterprise-grade user management and permission controls within the Hawiyat platform. This system ensures secure, granular access management across all platform features.

<Callout type="warning">
Administrative privileges are strictly limited to one user per instance to maintain security and accountability.
</Callout>

## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Authentication Layer**
   - User identification
   - Session management
   - Security protocols
   - Access tracking

2. **Authorization Layer**
   - Permission management
   - Role assignments
   - Access controls
   - Policy enforcement

3. **Audit System**
   - Activity logging
   - Access monitoring
   - Change tracking
   - Compliance reporting

## Permission Framework
