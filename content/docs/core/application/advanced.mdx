### Redirects

Redirect requests to your application to another URL based on specified rules, enhancing navigational efficiency and SEO.

- **Regex**: Enter a regular expression to match the URLs that need redirecting.
- **Replacement**: Specify the target URL where traffic should be redirected.
- **Permanent**: Toggle this option to apply a permanent (HTTP 301) redirection, indicating to browsers and search engines that the page has moved permanently.

#### Example
To redirect all traffic from "http://localhost" to "http://mydomain", set the Regex as `http://localhost/(.*)` and the Replacement as `http://mydomain/$1`.


### Security

Add basic authentication to your application to restrict access.

- **Username**: Enter a username.
- **Password**: Enter a password.

#### Important Note
Adding basic authentication will prompt users for a username and password before allowing access to the application. Use this for environments where an additional layer of security is required.


### Ports

Expose your application to the internet by configuring network ports, allowing external access.

- **Published Port**: The port number on the host that will route traffic to your application.
- **Target Port**: The port number inside the container that the application uses.
- **Protocol**: Choose between TCP and UDP based on your application's requirements.

#### Important Note
Ensure that the published port does not conflict with other services on the host to avoid port binding errors, also this port is used mostly for accesing the application from the outside, eg your-ip:port, this is not for accessing the application trought a domain.

### Traefik

Provides a dynamic and robust method to manage HTTP traffic to your services, including load balancing and SSL termination.

- **Rules**: Define complex routing, load balancing, and security configurations using Traefik's powerful rule-based configuration system.
