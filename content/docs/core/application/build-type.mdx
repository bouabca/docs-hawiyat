# Application Build System Guide

Hawiyat provides a sophisticated build system architecture that supports multiple build approaches, enabling developers to choose the most appropriate method for their specific use case. This comprehensive guide details the available build types, their benefits, and optimal usage scenarios.

## Build System Overview

Our platform offers three powerful build systems, each designed to meet different deployment requirements:

1. **Nixpacks** (Recommended Default)
   - Optimized for modern applications
   - Zero configuration deployment
   - Automatic dependency management

2. **Dockerfile**
   - Custom build environments
   - Full control over build process
   - Legacy application support

3. **Buildpacks**
   - Cloud-native deployment
   - Platform-agnostic builds
   - Standardized build process

## Nixpacks Build System

Nixpacks is Hawiyat's recommended build system, offering a powerful combination of automation, efficiency, and developer experience. This innovative build system automatically detects your application's requirements and creates optimized containers.

   - Layer minimization
   - Dependency deduplication
   - Resource efficiency

3. **Security Features**
   - Minimal base images
   - Security patches
   - Vulnerability scanning
   - Dependency auditing

### Supported Technologies

- **Languages**:
  - Node.js/JavaScript
  - Python
  - Ruby
  - Go
  - Java
  - PHP

## Dockerfile Build System

The Dockerfile build system provides complete control over the build process, ideal for applications requiring specific configurations or custom build steps.

### Features and Capabilities

1. **Build Configuration**
   - Custom base images
   - Multi-stage builds
   - Build arguments
   - Environment variables
   - Custom scripts

2. **Advanced Options**
   - Layer caching
   - Build contexts
   - Cross-platform builds
   - Build-time variables

3. **Integration Features**
   - CI/CD pipeline support
