description: Complete guide to authenticating with the Hawiyat CLI using token-based authentication.
---



The **Hawiyat CLI** uses a **token-based authentication** system to securely verify your identity and grant access to your Hawiyat resources.  
Instead of repeatedly entering a username and password, you generate a unique **access token** from your dashboard and use it for all CLI operations.

This method is secure, script-friendly, and ideal for automation pipelines such as **CI/CD**.

## How Authentication Works

The authentication process follows these steps:

1. **Generate an access token** from your Hawiyat account dashboard.
2. **Store the token** securely — the CLI saves it locally in a configuration file.
3. Every time you run a CLI command, the **token is sent** to the Hawiyat API.
4. The API verifies the token:
   - If valid → Command executes successfully.
   - If invalid → CLI displays an authentication error.
5. Tokens remain valid **until revoked** from the dashboard.

## Creating an Access Token

> ⚠ **Permissions Note:**  
> - **Admins** can generate tokens without restrictions.  
> - **Non-admin users** must have explicit permission to generate tokens.

**Steps to create a token:**
1. Log in to the **Hawiyat Dashboard**.
2. Go to **Settings → Profile**.
3. Scroll down to the **Access Tokens** section.
4. Click the **Generate** button.
5. Copy the generated token immediately — it will only be shown once.  
   By default, Hawiyat access tokens **do not expire** unless you revoke them.

## Storing the Access Token

When you authenticate through the CLI, Hawiyat automatically stores the token in a `config.json` file along with your server’s URL.

**Default storage locations:**
- **macOS / Linux:** `~/.hawiyat/config.json`
- **Windows:** `%USERPROFILE%\.hawiyat\config.json`

**Example `config.json` file:**
```json
{
  "server": "https://api.hawiyat.com",
  "token": "your-access-token"
}
